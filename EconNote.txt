  Economists define Economics through four perspectives
                                       a) Wealth           b) Welfare
                                       c) Scarcity         d) Growth
  Although there are four perspectives mentioned in the module the consenses
  Definition is : the tension between the unlimited human needs and the limited
                  resourses available on the planet.
  Resources: Karl Marxs in his famous book(i can't remember the title) defined
             resources as a) Land: its reward rent           c) Capital: its reward interest
                          b) Labour: its reward wage
                          Modern Economoics adds ----------- d) Entrepreneurship: its reward profit
  The Rationale behind economics is SCARCITY: limited resources forces humans(with unlimited desires)
                                 to CHOICE: limited output implying cost which is commonly called as
                                 an OPPORTUNITY COST: the next best alternative that must be sacrificed
